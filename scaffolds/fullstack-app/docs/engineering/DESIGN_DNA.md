# Design DNA

> Read this before any UI work. Short on purpose.
> Detailed rules → `docs/engineering/FRONTEND.md`. Product-specific direction → `docs/product/UI_UX.md`.

**Build on the default starter — do not start from scratch.**

The existing code in `apps/web/` is the foundation. Extend and adapt it; do not replace it
with a fresh generation. The layout structure, section rhythm, component patterns, token
wiring, and nav/footer shell are already correct — they are the starting point, not a
reference to look at and then ignore.

What you change per product:

- `globals.css` — swap the accent/brand color. Keep background white.
- `src/i18n/locales/en.json` — all rendered copy lives here (ADR-010), including the brand
  name, nav labels, hero, sections, and footer. Rewriting the copy = editing this file.
- `app/page.tsx` — replace sections and structure to fit the product. Keep the
  open-band composition unless `docs/product/UI_UX.md` explicitly calls for a different layout.
- `components/shared/site-header.tsx` — update nav routes and logo to match the product.
- `components/shared/site-footer.tsx` — update link routes.

What you do not change without a clear reason from `docs/product/UI_UX.md`:

- The white background and neutral surface tokens
- The sticky nav with surface treatment
- The open-band section pattern (hero, features, CTA band, footer)
- The `next/font` + `--font-sans` wiring
- The footer structure
- The two-tier header structure: utility tier (support, language, theme, auth entry) above the main tier (brand, routes, CTA)
- The language/theme placeholder controls in the utility tier (restyle, never remove)

If it could be from any AI demo site, it is not done.

## Palette

- All color from tokens in `globals.css` — never raw hex, never raw Tailwind palette classes
- **Background stays white.** `--background` must stay near-white and neutral — `0 0% 100%`
  or a very slight cool/neutral tint. Never warm, never cream, never beige. The clean white
  surface is the foundation of the starter's feel; warming it is the #1 way to break it.
- **What you change = the accent/brand color** (`--primary`, `--brand`, `--ring`). Surfaces,
  backgrounds, borders, and muted tones stay in the neutral white/gray family.
- **Forbidden feels** (current AI rotation — not a complete blocklist):
  - warm cream / beige background (`--background` with any warmth)
  - violet / indigo gradient
  - warm orange + cream
  - forest green + cream editorial
  - muted sage
  - dark-purple "SaaS" gradient
  - teal on near-black
- One accent color. Semantic colors (success, warning, destructive) are separate from brand

## Typeface

- Wire a modern sans via `next/font` → `--font-sans` → `font-sans` in Tailwind
- Leaving it unset = browser serif fallback = instant AI tell
- Max 3 weights: **400** (body) · **500 or 600** (medium) · **700** (bold)
- Hierarchy from size and weight, not decorative font switches

## Composition — the most violated rule

The starter uses **open sections as the default**. Cards earn their place.

| Context                                                | Use                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Hero, marketing sections, feature grids, promo bands   | Open bands — no card wrapper          |
| Product listings, data panels, dialogs, repeated items | Cards are appropriate                 |
| Stats / KPI strips on public pages                     | Only if they help the user's decision |

**Hard stops:**

- Hero content must not be wrapped in a card or panel
- Every section boxed in `bg-card border border-border rounded-lg` = card soup = fail
- Pale bordered rectangles are not a design system

## Focal point & surface weight

- **One focal point per screen.** The hero headline + primary action is the focal point of
  the first viewport. Nothing else in that viewport should compete with it for attention.
- **Dark/inverted bands are opt-in, never a default.** A sudden near-black
  (`bg-foreground`) panel reads as a jarring color break on an otherwise light page. The
  starter's closing CTA is a soft contained band (`bg-secondary` + border); use a dark
  inverted band only when `docs/product/UI_UX.md` explicitly calls for one, and never in
  the hero/first viewport.
- **In a split/two-column hero, the side panel must be lighter than the headline column**,
  not heavier. A promo panel beside the hero is fine (Tokopedia does it) — but use a soft
  surface (`bg-secondary`, `bg-muted`, a subtle border), not a solid near-black block.

## Navigation

- **The header is two tiers** (Shopee/Tokopedia anatomy, shipped as the foundation
  default):
  - **Utility tier** (slim strip on top, `bg-secondary/30 border-b`): the universal
    controls every product keeps - support/help, the language and theme switchers, and
    the auth entry. Per product, socials, seller, or download links also live here.
  - **Main tier**: brand, primary routes, and the one CTA - nothing with a
    locale-dependent width.
  - The reason is mechanical: switching language changes label widths ("Bahasa
    Indonesia" is twice "English"), and variable-width controls in the primary nav
    reflow every link beside them. Isolating them in the utility tier means the primary
    nav never shifts when locale or theme changes. Do not move utility controls into the
    main tier.
- `sticky top-0` with visible surface: `bg-background/80 border-b border-border backdrop-blur`
- Route-aware active state + `aria-current="page"` on every nav
- Mobile and desktop nav must show the same active link
- **Never put `overflow-x-hidden` on a sticky header's ancestor** (the layout shell, body,
  or any wrapper). `overflow-x: hidden` forces `overflow-y: auto`, turning that element into
  a scroll container and silently killing `position: sticky`. To kill horizontal scroll, use
  `overflow-x-clip` instead — it clips without creating a scroll container, so sticky still
  works. Better: find and constrain the element that actually overflows.
- For the backdrop blur to be visible, the header background must be partly transparent
  (`bg-background/80`), not near-opaque (`/95`). Blur on a solid fill shows nothing.
- **Auth controls are state-exclusive.** Signed-out shows "Sign in" (+ sign-up CTA);
  signed-in shows "Account". Never render both at once, and never render the same link
  twice in one bar.
- **The language and theme placeholder controls ship in every header**
  (`components/shared/header-controls.tsx`: globe + language label dropdown, sun/moon +
  theme label). They are placeholders until the product wires real i18n routing or dark
  mode - restyle them per product, do not remove them.

## Layout integrity

- **Text never overflows its container.** Labels under tiles, card titles, badges - if a
  string can be long, it wraps or truncates inside the box. A label spilling past its
  background is a bug, not a quirk.
- **Grids must balance.** An item grid that leaves an orphan empty slot at the end of a
  row reads as broken. Match item count to the column count per breakpoint, change the
  column count, or use a layout that handles the remainder (wrap chips, scrollable rail).
- **No fake stats strips.** Invented counters ("120K+ products", "8.4K sellers") prove
  nothing and read as filler - cut the strip entirely unless the numbers are real and the
  audience needs them for a decision.

## First viewport

- Hero headline + copy + CTA visible without scrolling at ~720px desktop height
- Navbar must not push hero below the fold
- Achieve by restraining padding — not by forcing `min-h-screen` (lint blocks it)

## Footer

- `border-t border-border` + brand + link columns + copyright line
- Not two faint lines of muted text floating at the bottom of the page

## Spacing

4px grid only — valid: `4 8 12 16 20 24 32 40 48 64 80 96px`
Arbitrary values like `p-[10px]` `gap-[14px]` `mt-[22px]` are violations.

## Interactions

- Every interactive element needs: hover (150ms) · focus ring (2px accent + 2px offset) · active (scale 0.98)
- Loading → skeleton matching content shape, not a spinner
- Animate `transform` and `opacity` only — never `width` `height` `top` `left`
- Max 800ms on any animation. Always respect `prefers-reduced-motion`

## Copy

- Plain English, specific, conventional terms
- No em dash, no decorative emoji, no AI-marketing filler
- No lorem ipsum, no "Feature Title", no "User Name" in rendered UI
- **No internal design vocabulary in user-facing copy.** Terms from the briefs and these
  docs ("search-led", "seller signals", "open bands", "surface budget", "clutter-free")
  describe the design TO the builder; they are not what users read. Write what a real
  customer would understand and a real company would publish.
- **No empty placeholder image boxes in rendered UI.** Mock data is fine; bare gray
  rectangles are not. Use real-looking imagery or a deliberate icon tile.
- **Mock state must be plausible, not fake-impressive.** No invented metrics ("120K+
  products"), no pre-filled cart badges, no fabricated review counts. Neutral or empty
  beats fake; anything mocked for layout gets flagged for removal before ship.

## Mandatory double-check after ANY frontend work

After building or changing `apps/web` UI, run this checklist **before** calling the work
done. It is **code-based — no rendering / screenshots needed** (those burn tokens and the
preview often isn't available). The point is to catch the silent bugs that pass a casual
code read: broken sticky, invisible blur, hero focal competition.

Run it in two passes. Part A is mechanical greps — run them, paste the output, do not
eyeball it. Part B is targeted code reading of three files.

### Part A — Mechanical greps (run the commands, report output)

Run from `apps/web/src`:

```
[ ] No overflow-x-hidden on any sticky ancestor (it silently kills position: sticky):
      grep -rn "overflow-x-hidden\|overflow-hidden" app/ components/
      → any hit on the layout shell, body, or a sticky header's wrapper is a FAIL.
        Use overflow-x-clip instead, or constrain the element that actually overflows.

[ ] Header background is partly transparent so backdrop-blur is visible:
      grep -rn "backdrop-blur" components/
      → the same element must use bg-background/80 (or similar), not /95 or a solid fill.

[ ] No raw hex or raw palette classes (tokens only):
      grep -rEn "#[0-9a-fA-F]{3,6}|(bg|text|border)-(red|blue|green|zinc|slate|violet|indigo|emerald|teal|orange|amber)-[0-9]" app/ components/
      → any hit is a FAIL.

[ ] No near-black inverted band without an explicit opt-in:
      grep -rn "bg-foreground" app/ components/
      → any hit on a section/band is a FAIL unless docs/product/UI_UX.md explicitly
        calls for a dark band there. In the hero/first viewport it is always a FAIL.

[ ] Background token is still white/neutral (only the accent changed):
      grep -n "\-\-background" styles/globals.css
      → must be 0 0% 100% or a near-neutral; any warm/cream value is a FAIL.

[ ] No off-grid spacing:
      grep -rEn "(p|m|gap|space)[a-z-]*-\[[0-9]" app/ components/
      → arbitrary values like p-[10px], gap-[14px] are FAILs.

[ ] pnpm lint passes (catches min-h-screen, and the patterns lint is wired to block)
[ ] pnpm run verify passes
```

### Part B — Read three files and reason (no render)

Open `app/page.tsx`, `app/layout.tsx`, and the site-header, then confirm by reading the markup:

```
[ ] Header has `sticky top-0` AND no overflow on its ancestors (cross-checks Part A) →
    the nav will actually pin on scroll.
[ ] The hero is one focal point: the headline + primary action carry the first section;
    no sibling element uses a heavy dark/inverted surface or competes at equal weight.
[ ] The hero is not wrapped in a card (no bg-card/border/rounded around the headline block),
    and there is no min-h-screen or oversized top padding pushing it down.
[ ] Footer markup has a real endcap: a top border/surface, brand/wordmark, link group(s),
    and a copyright line — not two muted text lines.
[ ] Sections are mostly open bands. Count the `bg-card`/`border ... rounded` wrappers: if
    nearly every section is boxed, that is card soup — FAIL.
[ ] A font is wired in layout.tsx via next/font and bound to --font-sans.
```

Reading the markup is enough for everything above — none of it needs a screenshot. The one
thing code cannot fully confirm is exact visual balance and fold height at a given screen
size; if that ever matters, note it as the residual risk rather than rendering by default.
