# INIT — Start a New Product

Use this once, when you first set up a product from this template.
For continuing work in a later chat, use `CONTINUE.md` instead.

Prerequisite: the repo is cloned, `pnpm install` has run, and `.env` is filled from
`.env.example` (Supabase URL + keys; Midtrans keys only if the product takes payments;
Hugging Face token only if it uses large models).

---

## Claude Code shortcut

Describe the product (or paste the PRD) in a fresh chat and run `/init-product` - it
executes this whole flow and stops for your review before any code. The prompt below is
for other tools, and the reference for what the command does.

## 1. Give the agent this prompt

Paste your PRD / product brief where marked, then send the whole block in a fresh chat:

```text
Read docs/guides/HOW_TO_USE_THIS_TEMPLATE.md and AGENTS.md first.
Initialize this product from the brief below.

=== PRODUCT BRIEF ===
<paste your PRD / product description here: what it is, who it is for,
goals, non-goals, the main features, and any design direction>
=== END BRIEF ===

Then, in order:
1. Fill docs/product/PRD.md and docs/product/FEATURES.md from the brief.
2. Read docs/engineering/DESIGN_DNA.md, then fill docs/product/UI_UX.md from my design direction.
   The starter UI in apps/web is the foundation: keep its white background,
   open-band layout, sticky nav, font wiring, and footer. Record what changes
   per product (accent color, content, routes), not a redesign from scratch.
3. Initialize only the domain docs that apply: API, BACKEND, DATABASE, PAYMENTS.
4. Generate docs/engineering/PROGRESS.md as the live build checklist (pointer-based, not a duplicate spec).
5. Run pnpm docs:check and report warnings separately from failures.

Do not start implementation until the docs are synchronized. Show me the filled
docs first so I can review before any code is written.
```

## 2. Review the docs, then build

- Read the docs the agent filled. Correct anything wrong before code is written.
- When the docs are right, tell the agent to start building from `docs/engineering/PROGRESS.md`.
- `pnpm dev` to run.

## 3. What the agent must follow while building

- Build on `apps/web/`, do not regenerate from scratch.
- Background stays white. Only the accent/brand color changes.
- After any UI work, run the code-based double-check at the bottom of `docs/engineering/DESIGN_DNA.md`
  (grep + read three files, no rendering).
- Keep `docs/engineering/PROGRESS.md` current as work happens.

## 4. End every session

Before you close the chat, make sure the agent updated:

- `docs/engineering/PROGRESS.md` — what is done and in progress
- `docs/engineering/DECISIONS.md` — any real technical decision made
- `docs/product/UI_UX.md` — any product design change

This is what lets the next chat pick up context. See `CONTINUE.md`.
