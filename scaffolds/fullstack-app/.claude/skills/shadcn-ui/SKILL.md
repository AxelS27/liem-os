description: Use when building or restyling any apps/web UI - landing pages, app screens, adding or customizing shadcn/ui components, or editing theme tokens. Enforces the customization discipline that keeps the result from looking generic-AI: opinionated palette first, every shadcn component retuned off its defaults, and a code-based self-review (no rendering) against the docs/engineering/DESIGN_DNA.md double-check. Read before touching apps/web or packages/ui visuals.

# shadcn/ui customization discipline

shadcn/ui is the component layer for this repo and it is **already wired** (ADR-003, ADR-014). This skill is not "how to add a component" - it is how to stop the UI from looking like a generic AI demo. The library is a skeleton; the look is what you do to it. Untouched shadcn defaults are the single most common AI tell.

This file is the **procedure**. `docs/engineering/FRONTEND.md` is the full **spec** - open it. This does not repeat its forbidden-patterns list.

## Step 0 - Do not rebuild the plumbing

The deterministic setup already exists. Do not re-run `shadcn init`, do not regenerate these, do not "accept defaults":

- `apps/web/components.json` - shadcn writes components into `@repo/ui` (packages/ui).
- `apps/web/src/styles/globals.css` - the **one** source of color AND the Tailwind config (v4 is CSS-first, there is no `tailwind.config.ts`): `:root` tokens, `@theme inline` utility mapping, the house type scale, and the `@source` that scans `packages/ui`. Semantic tokens only.
- `packages/ui/src/lib/cn.ts` - the `cn()` helper.
- `packages/ui/src/components/ui/button.tsx` - the **reference primitive**. Match its house style.

## Step 1 - Palette and identity first (before any screen)

The highest-leverage anti-generic move. Do it before building UI. First, skim `docs/product/REFERENCES.md`, find the closest vertical, and study one or two of those real products - they beat AI-landing-page patterns as a starting point.

1. Commit to a real palette for _this_ product. **No default violet/indigo, no glassmorphism/glow - and no other safe trendy default** (whatever look is in heavy AI rotation now, e.g. forest + cream, muted sage, dark-purple SaaS gradient, reads as a template). Pick a deliberate brand hue and neutrals with a slight temperature; check contrast.
2. Replace the neutral placeholder values in `:root` in `globals.css` (`--brand`, `--primary`, `--background`, `--muted`, ...). Shipping the placeholder neutral _is_ shipping the AI look.
3. Set one modern type family via next/font in the root layout; its variable (e.g. `--font-jakarta`) feeds the `--font-sans` token in `globals.css` `@theme inline`. The template ships this wired; swap the family for a product-appropriate modern sans, rename the variable and update the two `var()` references in `globals.css`, never fall back to the default serif/system font. One or two families total, no decorative serif-italic.
4. Tune `--radius` once to a deliberate value; the whole UI follows.

Retheming is this file only. If you are setting color anywhere else, you are doing it wrong.

## Step 2 - Add components, then RETUNE

```
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component>
```

It lands in `packages/ui` via `components.json`. **Never ship it as emitted.** Retune it to match `button.tsx`: radius, font weight, density and padding, token colors, a real `focus-visible` ring. A component that still reads as "default new-york" is not done.

Guardrails lint enforces automatically (a green build blocks them):

- No `min-h-screen` / `h-screen` / `100vh` to fill a section.
- No raw palette classes (`bg-zinc-*`, `text-gray-*`, violet/indigo, ...). Tokens only.
- No hardcoded hex in `className` (`bg-[#...]`).

Everything else in `docs/engineering/FRONTEND.md` is on you - lint cannot see layout.

## Step 3 - Compose with structure

Two tests, on every screen:

- If it could be any AI demo, it is not done.
- If an element exists only to look "cool", delete it.

Mock the layout first - rough markup in one file, no data wiring - until the structure feels right; don't let a database schema lock the design before you have seen it.

Build hierarchy from spacing, type scale, and weight before reaching for cards or borders, and disclose progressively (secondary actions in menus, not all surfaced inline). Use asymmetry and real content density, not centered-everything stacks. The landing hero (headline, copy, and primary CTA) must fit the first viewport without scrolling at ~720-768px; anchor the primary navbar (sticky with a real surface) so it does not scroll away. Whatever the product type, the finished page must read as clean: uncluttered, intentional, one focal point, no surfaces stacked on surfaces. Honor the App Structure rules in `docs/engineering/FRONTEND.md`: a real landing page (not a login wall), navbar + footer on public pages, anchor nav with an active state, one shared page scaffold. Ship one theme and one language (English) first. Keep `docs/engineering/PROGRESS.md` current as you build - what lives on each page, what connects to what, what is done - so a long build stays consistent.

## Step 4 - Self-review before you finish (code-based, no rendering)

Reading `docs/engineering/FRONTEND.md` is not applying it. **Before you consider any apps/web UI finished, run the code-based double-check at the bottom of `docs/engineering/DESIGN_DNA.md`,** then fix anything that misses.

- This review is **code-based — do not render the app or take screenshots** (it burns tokens and the preview often isn't available). Run the Part A greps and read `app/page.tsx`, `app/layout.tsx`, and the site header.
- The greps catch the silent traps that pass a casual code read (overflow-x-hidden killing sticky, near-opaque header hiding blur, bg-foreground stealing the hero focal point). The file reading covers section structure, card soup, focal point, and footer.

`pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck` passing does not cover a single layout check, but the greps plus reading the markup do. Rendering is only a last-resort tie-breaker for exact visual balance, never a required step.
